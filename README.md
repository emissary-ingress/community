## Community

This is a place for Emissary community related material. You can find information on the project governance, community meetings, and a list of all the project maintainers.

## Community Meetings

The Emissary project holds monthly community calls. To join or watch previous meeting notes and recordings, please see [meeting schedule](MEETING_SCHEDULE.md).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions at [any level](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

Note: We are in the process of migrating the [Ambassador GitHub repository](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) to this Github organization/repository. Due to the amount of automated infrastructure (tests, continuous integration, release, etc.), this migration is an interesting large amount of work; we expect to complete that move by July 2021. In the meantime:

* You can help [file or fix issues](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues) on the existing respository, and
* Check out [the code](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) from the existing repository
