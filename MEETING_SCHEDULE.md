# Community Meeting Schedule

We hold regular Ambassador Developer Office Hours typically on Thursdays. Every four to six weeks we dedicate a session to meeting the maintainers of Emissary-ingress.  These sessions are a way to connect in person to share updates and listen to feedback from the community.
